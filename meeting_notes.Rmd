Marc will look into memory issues home folders

**To do**:

* High quality sequnces needed for correct overlap, also large enough contigs needed to identify sequences. 
Look into sequencing methods (long reads, depth), data and if trimming is needed (how much? Quality vs abundance).
* https://kasperdanielhansen.github.io/genbioconductor/html/GenomicRanges_GRanges.html GRanges to work with genomic data in R
gldB sequence a good marker? Get gene sequence (use gviz)
* BLAST to find homologs, anything homologous? Multiple copies as well? Good marker gene?
